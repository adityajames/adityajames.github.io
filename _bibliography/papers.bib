  title={A Diagnostic Study of Emotional Intelligence Amongst Students of Business Management in a Premier Business School in India},
  author={Singh, Kavita and James, Aditya and Singh, Harsh},
  abstract={Over the past two decades, the importance of emotional intelligence in the Indian corporate sector has been significant. It is an important quality that a manger needs to possess to be a good leader. Since economic liberalization, many Indian companies have made their mark on the global map under the able guidance of home grown leaders. As India steps into the next phase of its economic development, there is a significant demand of competent managers and leaders. Indian management schools have an important role in this regard. In this paper we explore the level of emotional intelligence in the students studying in a top business school in India. The results highlight that the widely held belief of higher emotional intelligence quotient in females and non-engineers do not hold true in one of the premier management schools in India. Engineers and students with significant prior work experience outscore the other students on various components of emotional intelligence and the differences are statistically significant. This suggests a revision in curriculum of business management education so as to ensure that over the course of two years, students are given ample opportunities to develop their emotional intelligence and hone their skills towards becoming successful future leaders.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
