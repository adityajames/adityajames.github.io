Stay hungry stay curious, hungry to continuously improve and curious to learn new skills. 

In my 9+ years of professional experience I have worked across retail banking analytics and web product management. As part of the retail banking analytics team I’ve worked on a range of projects in the areas of liabilities, assets, digital and customer experience analytics. I was awarded on multiple occasions for innovation and project delivery under tight timelines, a few of them being Star performer award (Q1,’15), Delivering the promise (Q2,’15), Cutting edge solution award (Q2,’15).

As a web product manager I was responsible for online holidays product for Makemytrip India private limited. In a span of 8 months I was able to successfully integrate Hotel travel API to open up $76B opportunity in the international holidays segment. I spearheaded the integration of the Viator activities API into the Makemytrip ecosystem. I was awarded the rising star award (Q2,’14) for my outstanding performance.

I’m very passionate about photography and worked as part of the core team that created the Nike ‘Make Every Yard Count’ ad film. The film won 7 awards at the 67th Cannes film festival ( 4 Silver and 3 bronze lions ).

If you have a challenging business problem then I want to help you solve it.
